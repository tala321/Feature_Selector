Feature Selection Project Using Genetic Algorithm
This project allows users to upload CSV datasets and apply a genetic algorithm to select the most relevant features. It combines a Django backend with a React frontend, aiming to improve model performance by identifying optimal subsets of data attributes.

Getting Started with Create React App
This frontend was bootstrapped with Create React App.
Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
npm start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see lint errors in the console.
npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.
npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about deployment for more information.
npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!
If you're not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time.
This command will copy all configuration files and dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project so you have full control.
You don’t have to ever use eject—the curated setup is suitable for most deployments.
